Game made for Software Development course at CSUF. Based on an idea for a board game by Chase Traver.

Mechanum is run from _main_.py and uses Python 3.9 and Pygame.

In Mechanum you play as Robbie the Robot or the Doomcopter, and your goal is to defeat the monsters that are attacking you by playing cards from your hand to maneuver around the board and fight the monsters. 

The main menu can be navigated by left clicking the various buttons. An in-game tutorial is available to explain the game mechanics.

Cards can be selected by left clicking the button, and movement is determined via directional input using the arrow keys.
